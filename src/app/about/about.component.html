    <p class="bold-greeting">How I Got Into Development âŒ¨</p>
    <p class="text-format">
      I used to create 3D animations with Blender and even tried game
      development with Unity. I was always intrigued by how web and mobile
      applications were made. I eventually did a google search which caused me
      to stumble upon web development and FreeCodeCamp. Once I discovered the
      possibilities, I was sold.

    <p class="bold-greeting">How About Now? ðŸ“ˆ</p>
    <p class="text-format">
      I enjoy learning new technologies and using my skills to build real-world
      products that can grow a client's business or help a friend with their app
      idea.
    </p>

    <p class="text-format">
      I currently specialize in Vue for the frontend and Node on the backend.
      Other technologies I've picked up along the way are Nuxt, Angular,
      TypeScript, AWS (RDS & S3), Ubuntu Linux, Nginx, Docker, and SQL.
